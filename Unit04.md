**Unit 4: The Development of the Novel and its Various Forms** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Just as the short story emerged as a new literary form due to cultural,
social, and economic changes, the novel moved from being regarded as
subliterary to being the most popular form by the end of the era.  Works
by writers such as Hawthorne continue to stand among the greatest novels
in world history while those by authors such as George Thompson and
Fanny Fern gained unprecedented popularity by mining sensation and
sentimental sub-genres.*

-   **Reading: Washington State University-Pullman: Professor Donna M.

    Fern’s [Sara Payson Willis] Ruth Hall**
    Links: Washington State University-Pullman: Professor Donna M.
    Campbell’s “[Domestic or Sentimental Fiction,
    1820–1865](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ENGL405-4.4-Domestic-or-Sentimental-Fiction-1820.pdf)”

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: First, please click on the link to “Domestic or
    Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865,” and read the introduction to
    domestic sentimentalism from Professor Campbell to expand on the
    ideas presented in the previous reading.  Then, click on the second
    link above, and read *Ruth Hall,* the autobiographical novel by one
    of the most famous authors of the era, Fanny Fern, the pseudonym of
    Sara Payson Willis.  Willis’s novel, as with much of her writing,
    both embraces and critiques domestic ideology (for more on this line
    of thinking, see subunit 6.1).  She defends her autobiographical
    heroine’s foray into the public world of publishing in terms of her
    role as a mother, while simultaneously revealing, with caustic wit
    and satire, the hypocrisy of those who object to women taking a more
    active role in financially providing for themselves and their
    families.  As such, her novel does not fit squarely within the
    category of domestic sentimental fiction but rather delineates some
    of the ideas behind such fiction as well as their limits.  
      
      These readings should take approximately 6 hours to complete.
