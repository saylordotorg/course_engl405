**Unit 3: The Invention of the Short Story** <span id="3"></span> 
*While most critics and writers during the period continued to view
poetry as the most important literary genre, the period is now better
known for its prose works.  The short story, as a form, first came into
its own in the United States during this period, with writers such as
Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and others exploring the
aesthetic and thematic possibilities of compact prose works of
fiction.  *
