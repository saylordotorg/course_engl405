**Unit 2: Continuity and Change in Poetic Form** <span id="2"></span> 
*The American Renaissance explored older literary forms and developed
new ones as it shaped and responded to the changing nature of American
society.  Following European romanticism, many American poets re-defined
poetry less in terms of preconceived form than in terms of organic
structure.  Doing so led to some of the most important formal
innovations of the time, especially those of Walt Whitman and Emily
Dickinson.  At the same time, debates around poetry circulated around
both form and content, as exemplified by Edgar Allan Poe’s influential
criticism.  *
