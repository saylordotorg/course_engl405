**Unit 6: The Question of Women's Place in U.S. Society** <span
id="6"></span> 
*With the economic transformations sometimes called the market
revolution, gender relations in the United States also changed.  Where
in a rural, agrarian economy, men and women often worked—even when
divided along gender lines—side-by-side in the same location, the farm
and the home, the move to a more professionalized, capitalist workplace
more firmly established distinctions between male and female work (or
for some classes at least).  Alongside political changes that empowered
all white men, these transformations coincided with an increasing
emphasis on women’s importance in the private sphere in opposition to
men’s dominance in the public realm.  In this section, we examine some
of the ways that the antebellum era saw the emergence of the modern
feminist movement in the United States and increasing literary attention
to the place of women in society. *

    version of Margaret Fuller’s “The Great Lawsuit, Man versus Men,
    Woman versus Women”**

    Fuller”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ENGL405-6.2-Transcendentalism.pdf) (PDF),

     Instructions: Please read the scholarly assessment of Fuller’s
    contribution to literary history from the authoritative, 18-volume
    Cambridge history, and then read Fuller’s essay in which she applies
    transcendentalist thought to the question of women’s rights.  Note
    that Fuller’s essay, “The Great Lawsuit,” was published in *The
    Dial,* which she co-edited with Emerson.  She later expanded this
    essay into the book *Woman in the Nineteenth Century*.  Fuller, as
    with many early feminists, connects the difficulties women face to
    the evil of slavery in making her case for women to develop their
    souls as freely and fully as they can.  Further note that she makes
    few to no allusions to legal or political changes, as later
    feminists would insist upon.   
        
     This reading should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to
    complete.

     Instructions: Please read the entirety of Stoddard’s emotionally
    complex short story.  Note that Stoddard’s story is told by the main
    character, who is trapped by her gender and her class.  The story

    subservience, even as it explores the complicity of the narrator’s
    own sexuality in her entrapment. This reading should take
    approximately 1 hour to complete.
