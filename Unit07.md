**Unit 7: The Slavery Controversy and Abolitionist Literature** <span
id="7"></span> 
*Perhaps no controversy defined the antebellum period as much as
slavery.  Even as politicians repeatedly attempted to find ways to paper
over sectional differences and quiet the controversy, the issue became
more and more divisive, eventually becoming the leading cause of  the
Civil War.  Throughout this course we have examined texts that
investigate slavery.  In this section, we will focus on abolitionist
literature, looking at some of the founding statements of the radical
abolitionist movement as well as some of the most popular texts of the
era.*

     Instructions: Please read Douglass’s incredibly influential work
    and Jacobs’ revisionary account of the life of a slave woman.  Note
    that *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* became a best
    seller, providing a model for many other slave narratives.  Jacobs’

    file, and read Stowe’s influential novel in its entirety (467
    pages).  Note that Stowe’s abolitionist novel *Uncle Tom’s Cabin*
    was the best-selling novel of the nineteenth century and arguably
    played a major role in fueling antislavery commitments in the
    North.  Drawing on sentimental tropes and the emotional fervor of
    nineteenth-century American Protestantism, it combines its
    antislavery arguments with idealized portraits of motherhood and
    stereotypes of African Americans.   
     Reading the novel should take approximately 10-12 hours to
    complete.   
      
     Terms of Use: *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* by Harriet Beecher Stowe is in
