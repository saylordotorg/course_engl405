Course Syllabus for "ENGL405: The American Renaissance"
-------------------------------------------------------

As most famously defined by F. O. Matthiessen in his groundbreaking
book, *The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of
Emerson and Whitman* (1941), the “American Renaissance” demarcates a
period of tremendous literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that
marked the cultivation, for the first time, of a distinctively American
literature.  For Matthiessen and many other critics, its key
figures—Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville—sought to define and explore
the new American identity, carving out new modes of expression and
self-identification.  In the years since Matthiessen’s important work
and especially in the past several decades, this characterization of the
literary period has been challenged on several fronts, for overstating
the innovations of these few authors, for the exclusion of women,
African-American, and more popular authors from its account of the
United States during a period of social and cultural upheaval and
transition, and for its acceptance of a myth of American exceptionalism.
We begin this course by taking a look at context: What was it in
American culture and society that led to the dramatic outburst of
literary creativity in this era?  We then explore some of the period’s
most famous works, approaching them by genre category.  Finally, we
attempt to define the emerging American identity represented in this
literature.

### Course Information

Welcome to ENGL405, The American Renaissance.  Below, please find
general information on the course and its requirements. 

**Course Designer:** Robert Bullington and Paul Gilmore

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a variety of free
online resources.  Most of the material consists of literary texts from
the mid-nineteenth century, some of it quite lengthy.  Secondary
materials (criticism, historical background, literary analyses)
similarly come from a variety of free online resources.  Some of the
sources that appear most frequently include the following:

-   Short essays by leading scholars from eNotes’ version of “[American
    History through
    Literature](http://www.enotes.com/american-history-literature-cc)”
-   Thematic videos featuring leading scholars from the Annenberg
    Foundation’s “[American Passages: A Literary
    Survey](http://www.learner.org/resources/series164.html?pop=yes&pid=1742)”
-   A variety of materials compiled on Professor Ann Woodlief’s site
    (Virginia Commonwealth University-Richmond), “[The Web of American
    Transcendentalism](http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/index.html)”

 

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Your main task is to read the primary texts fully and carefully, using
the secondary resources—introductory essays, video materials, and so
forth—to help you understand the literary works more fully.  At the end
of the course, you will need to complete the final exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of
approximately 118 hours to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at these time advisories to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then
set goals for yourself.

**Tips/Suggestions:** As noted above, much of the work in this course
consists of reading long literary works (often novels).  Determine what
format allows you to read these materials most easily for
comprehension.  Consider taking notes, electronically or in longhand, as
you read, and if you have questions after reading the texts, go back to
the secondary materials for more sources and for clarification.
