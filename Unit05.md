**Unit 5: Nature and Technology: Creating and Challenging American
Identity** <span id="5"></span> 
*Writers in the American Renaissance sought to identify the promise and
uniqueness of the American experience through various forms and genres.
 In this unit, we will look at ways in which these authors represented
the new American identity—its voices, its landscapes, and its
diversities. As often as they helped to construct long-standing ideals
of the American self-made man, of upward mobility and economic progress,
and of universal liberty and equality, they also criticized the ways
that American society and its political and cultural institutions failed
to live up to its ideals and the ways that economic and technological
development came at a great price.  In this and the following two units,
we will look at ways in which these authors represented and questioned
the new American identity and the forces and controversies transforming
the young nation.  Specifically in this section we will examine
reactions to the industrial, economic, and technological transformation
of the United States that was beginning to transform the nation from a
rural, agrarian country to a modern, capitalist one.*

    and read this introductory overview of antebellum U. S. literature’s
    relationship to technological development and industrialization
    during the era.  The reading should take approximately 15 minutes to
    complete.

-   **Reading: Orestes Brownson’s “The Laboring Classes”**
    Link: Orestes Brownson’s “[The Laboring
    Classes](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/SAYLOR-ENGL405-5.1-LABORING.pdf)”

    and read one of the most powerful critiques of capitalism in the
    antebellum United States, Orestes Brownson’s “Laboring Classes” (25
    pages).  Note that Orestes Brownson was a leading transcendentalist,
    representing its more social-activist wing (as opposed, perhaps, to
    Emerson).  In the years following the publication of this essay,
    though, he became increasingly conservative, renouncing his radical
    past and transcendentalism and converting to Catholicism.  This
    reading should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to
    complete.

    division of labor (and leisure) during the period.  These two
    stories should take approximately 2 hours to read.  
        
     Terms of Use: “Bartleby, the Scrivener” by Herman Melville and “The

    links to explore the text further.  Note the following: Thoreau’s
    *Walden* denies most genre categories including the novel,
    autobiography, and narrative; instead, the work roams freely from
    subject to subject, discussing the cycle of seasons, the experience
    of solitude, and local attractions, among other things.  “Resistance
    to Civil Government,” also known as “Civil Disobedience,” was
    written in response to the U.S.-Mexican War and the slavery
    controversy and influenced such twentieth-century leaders as Mahatma
    Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.  These readings should take
    approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete.
