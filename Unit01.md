**Unit 1: The American Renaissance in Context** <span id="1"></span> 
*What was happening in society and culture that might have spurred the
explosion of literary expression seen during the antebellum period of
American history?  (For those of you not up to speed on your U.S.
history, "antebellum" refers to the period before the Civil War and is
generally considered to span the years between 1781-1860, which in turn
includes what is known as "The American Renaissance" period of
literarature, between 1830-1860.)  In this unit, we will situate the
American Renaissance in its sociohistorical context.  We start with a
broad overview of the literary period and different ways of framing it
before moving on to examine the economic, political, and social changes
that were transforming the United States—industrialization and
urbanization, the development of mass politics, the debate over slavery,
Western expansion.  Turning to American culture during this period, we
then investigate the growth of literacy and the expansion of education,
the religious revival sometimes called the second Great Awakening, and
the emergence of urban popular culture.  Finally, we look at
transcendentalism, the religious-philosophical movement that gave rise
to some of the most important literary figures of the period, including
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller. *

     Instructions: Please read Kathryn VanSpankeren’s overview of the
    romantic period in U. S. literature. Many use the labels "American
    Romanticism" and "the American Renaissance" interchangeably; as you
    dig into this course, ask yourself whether you see a potential
    distinction between these two terms and what they define. Then,
    please read the course-specific account of recent revisions to our

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Emerson’s and Truth’s famous orations in
    their entirety.   In his speech, delivered at Harvard University in
    1837, Emerson calls for a new creative spirit in America; America
    evidently responded in kind.  Many consider this speech the rallying
    cry for the American Renaissance.  Truth’s speech, at a Women’s
    Rights Convention in 1851, offers an alternative account of the
    challenges Americans—especially women and people of color—faced in
    defining themselves during this period.  Consider how Emerson and
    Truth define self-making differently and similarly and ways of
    understanding those similarities and differences. This trope of
    "self-making" will resurface time and time again in the literature
    we read throughout this course, and should begin to inform the way
    you understand the "American Renaissance" as a literary genre or
    movement.

    his thought.  The essay was first published in 1841 in its entirety,
    but elements of the essay appeared in one of the author’s journal
    entries as early as 1832 and in various public lectures given in the
    intervening years.  As such, “Self-Reliance” reflects the idea that
    individualism was a necessary ingredient for success popular during
    the 1830s and 1840s.

     Instructions: Please click on the first link above, and read the
    short overview of George Ripley and Brook Farm from *The* *Cambridge
    History.*  Use the navigation buttons to proceed to Parts 13 and
    14.  Then, please click on the second link above to read the
    exchange between Ripley and Emerson.  Consider Emerson’s notion of
    reform as put forth in “Self-Reliance” (sub-subunit 1.2.3) in
    contrast to Ripley’s plan for Brook Farm. Note that in his letter to
    Emerson, Ripley—the founder of Brook Farm—lays out a number of core
    transcendental views on social reform, including humane
    relationships, respect for individual freedom, and the merging of
    values and ideas with spiritual events.  He believed that Brook Farm
    would serve as a transformative model for society.  For Emerson’s
    reply, please click on the last link above, and read just pages
    314–318.  As *The Cambridge History* points out, Emerson’s refusal
    to join the community represents the more individualistic and more
    famous side of transcendentalism.  He emphasizes that the first and
    most important thing to reform is the self, and that all social and
    cultural reform will follow naturally once the self is reformed. 
    While Emerson abstained from the Brook Farm project, he would later
    become increasingly involved in the anti-slavery movement, even as
    he consistently was skeptical of organized reform movements.   Parts
    13 and 14 of *The Cambridge History* discuss another leading
    transcendentalist, Theodore Parker, and his role as a leading critic
    of slavery and capitalist economic exploitation.  Further, as we
    will see in later units when we examine Margaret Fuller and Orestes
    Brownson, many other transcendentalists offered trenchant social
    critiques on other issues, sometimes speaking in favor of specific
    social changes and political causes, even if they did not see Brook
    Farm as the vehicle for reforming society.  Thus, while most leading
    transcendentalists did not participate in Brook Farm and many
    questioned its emphasis on community reform over individual reform,
    it represents a key element of transcendentalist thought: the
    attempt to link individual spiritual improvement to social reform.
